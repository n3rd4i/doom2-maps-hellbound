    <description>

    Hellbound is a limit-removing 32-level megawad created by Zoltan Sofalvi (Z86). Most maps are connected, in that the sense that the end of one map resembles the start area of the next. A second WAD, with the file name "HBFM29.wad," is included, which contains the full version of MAP29. This is because MAP29's extreme level of detail causes heavy drops in frame rate on lower-end computers, particularly in ZDoom-based ports, and the cut-down version in the main WAD attempts to rectify this, though in reality, the difference is negligible.

    Hellbound was uploaded to the idgames archive on 29 June, 2013. It was praised for its aesthetic quality, but criticised for its gameplay, which many found to be mostly uninteresting. Due to this, it missed out on a win at the 20th Annual Cacowards, being named as a runner-up instead.
